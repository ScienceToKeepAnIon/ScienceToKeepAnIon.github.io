nuqneH! :smiley: I am Taran from Bengaluru, an aspiring entrepreneur, engineer and quite possibly, the biggest nerd you're ever going to meet :neckbeard:. Yes, I'm that kid who obsesses over his typing speed and also plays the violin :violin: (Shocking!). I thoroughly enjoy Renaissance literature and also will never miss a chance to dress up in Victorian fashion :bowtie:. You will find me usually at the Planetarium :milky_way:, preferably just after heavy rain, isolated from the world, listening to Tartini or Bach (Count Dracula himself fancies them I heard), madly scribbling equations in my book. Or in my room, listening to works that 19th century villains listened to :ghost:, sipping super dark and strong coffee, madly typing away at some code on my PC.

I'm a person who loves to see the science in everything (You will be surprised at my ability to drag it into literally every conversation) and I derive great pleasure from introducing mind-blowing ideas to people :grin:. 

One day, while I was writing my journal and riding my rather lengthy train of thought, I had one of those many moments where I thought, "If only more people knew about this :confused:", and I finally decided to do something about it and so, here we are :grinning:. I will be writing about matters of great interest to me and my thoughts about them hoping that others find them interesting and informational too, like a journal of sorts. This blog will definitely scratch that curiosity itch for you. I believe that the brain is a muscle that should be kept fit :muscle:.

Favourite anime: Code Geass

Favourite formula: $$\frac 1 2​ <\lfloor mod(\lfloor \frac y {17}\rfloor 2^{−17\lfloor x\rfloor −mod(\lfloor y\rfloor ,17)},2)\rfloor$$ aka Tupper's self-referential formula (It's really interesting, you should look it up).

If you haven't realised, the headline is a reference to the atomic spectral series :sweat_smile:.
