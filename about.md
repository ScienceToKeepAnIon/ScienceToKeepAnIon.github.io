I am Taran from Bengaluru, an aspiring entrepreneur, engineer and quite possibly, the biggest nerd you're ever going to meet :neckbeard:. Yes, I'm that kid who obsesses over his typing speed and also plays the violin :violin: (Shocking!). I thoroughly enjoy Renaissance literature and also will never miss a chance to dress up in Victorian fashion :bowtie:. You will find me usually at the [Planetarium](https://taralaya.org/){:target="_blank"} :milky_way:, preferably just after heavy rain, isolated from the world, listening to Tartini or Bach (Count Dracula himself fancies them I heard), madly scribbling equations in my book. Or in my room, listening to works that 19th century villains listened to :ghost:, sipping super dark and strong coffee, madly typing away at some code on my PC.

I enjoy solving the cube. I keep trying to get better times and do cool stuff like solve it blindfolded or single-handed. I also love to write using fountain pens (They're just :heart_eyes_cat:). I pass my free time (not that I have any :tired_face:) taking apart electronics or finding new ways to ethically hack into PCs :smiling_imp:.

I'm a person who loves to see the science in everything (You will be surprised at my ability to drag it into literally every conversation) and I derive great pleasure from introducing mind-blowing ideas to people :grin:. 

One day, while I was writing my journal and riding my rather lengthy train of thought, I had one of those many moments where I thought, "If only more people knew about this :confused:", and I finally decided to do something about it and so, here we are :grinning:. I will be writing about matters of great interest to me and my thoughts about them hoping that others find them interesting and informational too, like a journal of sorts. That would be basically anything and everything which involves science or technology.

This blog is for those who are driven and want to be at the very frontier of human understanding, but at the same time peer into the depths and explore every corner of it. For those with open minds. "Curiosity killed the cat. But satisfaction brought it back." Well, bugger off, Schrödinger :joy:.

This is my first blog :neutral_face:. I am always open to any questions, suggestions, disagreements, complaints or any other feedback. In fact, I hope you reach out to me regarding what you read here, as I love a good discussion, and a good argument, both in equal measure :smile:. I would also love to hear about any work that my blog articles were the inspiration for.

This blog will definitely scratch that curiosity itch for you. I believe that the brain is a muscle that should be kept fit :muscle:.

Favourite anime: Code Geass

Favourite formula: $$\frac 1 2​ <\lfloor mod(\lfloor \frac y {17}\rfloor 2^{−17\lfloor x\rfloor −mod(\lfloor y\rfloor ,17)},2)\rfloor$$ aka [Tupper's self-referential formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper%27s_self-referential_formula){:target="_blank"} (It's really interesting, you should look it up).

If you haven't realised yet, the headline is a reference to the [atomic spectral series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series){:target="_blank"} :sweat_smile:.
