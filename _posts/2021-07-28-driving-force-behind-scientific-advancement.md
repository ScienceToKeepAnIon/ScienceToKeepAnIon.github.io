Welcome to the first part of this series of posts 'Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement'. Today we talk about religion as one of the factors.

<!--more-->

We all have been directly or indirectly involved in science at least once in our lives. If not, we have for sure, benefitted from it in our daily lives. The lives that we live today are mostly because of science. But have you ever stopped to wonder what exactly drives it? What exactly hastens the process of innovation? Of research? :confused:

## Introduction

We've come a long way in science. from the prehistoric ages where all knowledge was passed on orally to today where most of the knowledge is at our fingertips, a Google search away. :satisfied:

But what exactly is it?

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/What is it.gif" image_alt="What is it?" image_title="What is it?" %}

According to dictionary.com, it is *"a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws."*

I know most of you didn't understand that. :dizzy_face:

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Complicated.gif" image_alt="Complicated" image_title="Complicated" %}

So in simple words, it's the study of patterns. We started with studying the daily patterns of the Sun and then moved to everything else. This study of regularities in nature was required by humankind to survive.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Survive.gif" image_alt="Survive" image_title="Survive" %}

Now, what is religion you ask? Oxford says that it is *"the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods"*.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Religion.gif" image_alt="Religion" image_title="Religion" %}

Now, coming back to the question, what motivated science to progress? Let's examine them carefully. :mag:

I know what you're thinking, of all things, religion? Seriously?

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Seriously.gif" image_alt="Seriously?" image_title="Seriously?" %}

We all know that most scientists today aren't necessarily the most devoted and religious people on the planet :neutral_face:, but just hear me out.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Hear me out.gif" image_alt="Hear me out" image_title="Hear me out" %}

Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavours that may vary across cultures and change over time.

> "Religion will not regain its old power until it can face change in the same spirit as does science." -Alfred North Whitehead

## Pre-critical Science

### Early Europe

Around 2500 BCE, there appeared to be some intellectually significant activity, particularly in Europe. Evidence for this can be found in the United Kingdom and Northwestern Europe.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Stonehenge.jpg" image_alt="Stonehenge" image_title="Stonehenge" %}

The most well-known of these is [Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge){:target="_blank"}, which is located on the Salisbury Plain in England. It is a magnificent monument that exemplifies extremely high technical and social skills. It would have been impossible to transport such massive blocks of stone over long distances. :open_mouth: 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Magnificent.gif" image_alt="Magnificent" image_title="Magnificent" %}

These prehistoric megalithic structures serve both religious and astronomical functions. It demonstrates a high level of mathematical sophistication because they needed to understand the Pythagorean theorem. This appears to have been known in Asia, the Middle East, and Neolithic Europe nearly two millennia before Pythagoras was born.

Such a close relationship between religion and astronomy has been discovered in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Central America, and India. Science, in its current form, arose solely in the Western world. However, it is critical to consider the protosciences that had emerged in various regions, as it may contain knowledge that traditional science does not. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Critical.gif" image_alt="Critical" image_title="Critical" %}

### [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_and_technology_in_China){:target="_blank"}

The Chinese considered the whole universe to be a single vast organism. Early astronomy here had a close relationship with religion, which gave it a unique ritualistic dimension that later stimulated the growth of mathematics.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Liu Hui.jpg" image_alt="Liu Hui" image_title="Liu Hui" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Zu Chongzhi.jpg" image_alt="Zu Chongzhi" image_title="Zu Chongzhi" %}

In the third century CE, [Liu Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui){:target="_blank"} developed algebraic methods in geometry and calculated pi to five significant figures in 330 BCE. [Zu Chongzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi){:target="_blank"} improved on this in 480 BCE by discovering the [355/113 ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC){:target="_blank"}, which remained the most accurate value for the next 1200 years. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Accurate.gif" image_alt="Accurate" image_title="Accurate" %}

Astronomy and astrology were incorporated into the Chinese government system from the beginning of the Chinese state in the second millennium BCE. Later, alchemy, medicine, geology, and other sciences were encouraged by the state and reached heights not seen in the West until the Renaissance.

The emphasis was on practicality in other sciences as well, because the Chinese, almost alone among ancient peoples, did not fill the cosmos with gods and demons whose arbitrary wills determined events. Order was inherent and thus expected. It was up to humans to detect, describe, and profit from this order. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Order.gif" image_alt="Order" image_title="Order" %}

### [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_and_technology_in_the_Indian_subcontinent){:target="_blank"}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Indian Numerals.jpg" image_alt="Indian Numerals" image_title="Indian Numerals" %}

Similarly, in India, astronomy was studied for calendrical purposes for both practical and religious tasks, with a focus on the solar and lunar motions. Early Indian mathematics was also quite advanced, and it would later spread to the West as [Hindu-Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system){:target="_blank"}.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Aryabhata.jpg" image_alt="Aryabhata" image_title="Aryabhata" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Aryabhatiya.jpg" image_alt="Aryabhatiya" image_title="Aryabhatiya" %}

The people of this civilization made bricks with dimensions of 4:2:1, which was thought to be favourable for the stability of a brick structure. They also attempted to standardise length measurement to a high degree of accuracy. Indian astronomer and mathematician [Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata){:target="_blank"} (476–550 CE), in his [Aryabhatiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya){:target="_blank"} (499 CE) introduced the sine function in trigonometry.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Brahmagupta.png" image_alt="Brahmagupta" image_title="Brahmagupta" %}

In 628 CE, [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta){:target="_blank"} suggested that gravity was a force of attraction.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Tantrasangraha.png" image_alt="Tantrasangraha" image_title="Tantrasangraha" %}

[Nilakantha Somayaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji){:target="_blank"} updated the Aryabhatan model for the interior planets, Mercury, and Venus in the [Tantrasangraha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantrasamgraha){:target="_blank"} treatise, and the equation he specified for the centre of these planets was more accurate than those in European or Islamic astronomy until the time of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Bhaskaracharya.jpg" image_alt="Bhaskaracharya" image_title="Bhaskaracharya" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Siddhanta Shiromani.jpg" image_alt="Siddhanta Shiromani" image_title="Siddhanta Shiromani" %}

The [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas){:target="_blank"}, India's religious literature, contains the first textual mention of astronomical concepts.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Vedas.jpg" image_alt="Vedas" image_title="Vedas" %}

The first 12 chapters of [Bhaskaracharya's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_II){:target="_blank"} [Siddhanta Shiromani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddh%C4%81nta_Shiromani){:target="_blank"}, written in the 12th century, cover topics such as mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; planet latitudes; risings and settings; the moon's crescent; conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets with each other. The second part's 13 chapters cover the nature of the sphere as well as significant astronomical and trigonometric calculations based on it.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Susruta.jpg" image_alt="Susruta" image_title="Susruta" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Susruta Samhita.jpg" image_alt="Susruta Samhita" image_title="Susruta Samhita" %}

Evidence of proto-dentistry among an early farming culture has been discovered in Neolithic graveyards in what is now Pakistan. The ancient text [Suśruta Samhitā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita){:target="_blank"} of [Suśruta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta){:target="_blank"} describes various surgical procedures, such as rhinoplasty, the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal lithotomy, cataract surgery, and several other excisions and surgical procedures. 

### America

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Mayan civilisation.jpg" image_alt="Mayan civilisation" image_title="Mayan civilisation" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Mayan calendar.jpg" image_alt="Mayan calendar" image_title="Mayan calendar" %}

We've all heard about the fascinating [Mayan civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization){:target="_blank"} in America. The [Mayan calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar){:target="_blank"} was based on older civilisations that were clever and had religious significance.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Clever.gif" image_alt="Clever" image_title="Clever" %}

The positions of the bright planet Venus, as well as the eclipses were extremely significant in this location and were the result of meticulous observation. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Meticulous.gif" image_alt="Meticulous" image_title="Meticulous" %}

The Maya observed celestial bodies with great care, meticulously recording astronomical data on the movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and stars. Because this information was used for divination, Maya astronomy was primarily used for astrological purposes. Although the priesthood primarily used Maya astronomy to comprehend past cycles of time and project them into the future to produce prophecy, it also had some practical applications, such as assisting in crop planting and harvesting.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Dresden Codex.jpg" image_alt="Dresden Codex" image_title="Dresden Codex" %}

Solar and lunar eclipses were regarded as particularly dangerous events capable of wreaking havoc on the world.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Danger.gif" image_alt="Dangerous" image_title="Dangerous" %}

A solar eclipse is depicted in the [Dresden Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Codex){:target="_blank"} by a serpent devouring the kin ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded so that the Maya could predict them and perform the necessary ceremonies to ward off disaster. 

### [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East){:target="_blank"}

#### [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt){:target="_blank"}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Ancient Egypt.jpg" image_alt="Ancient Egypt" image_title="Ancient Egypt" %}

The ancient Egyptians developed a decimal number system around 3000 BCE. They even created an official calendar with twelve months, thirty days each, and a five-day holiday at the end of the year.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Ancient Egyptian medicine.jpg" image_alt="Ancient Egyptian medicine" image_title="Ancient Egyptian medicine" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Medical papyri.jpg" image_alt="Medical papyri" image_title="Medical papyri" %}

Egypt was the epicentre of Mediterranean alchemy research. The ancient Egyptians believed that most diseases were caused by the invasion of bodies by evil forces or spirits, according to [medical papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_medical_papyri){:target="_blank"} written between 2500 and 1200 BCE. They believed that the efficacy of their medicines was dependent on proper preparation and administration. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Life after death in Egypt.jpg" image_alt="Life after death in Egypt" image_title="Life after death in Egypt" %}

A slew of benevolent gods presided over the establishment of cosmic order in Egypt. Egypt, in contrast to China, was very peaceful and beautiful. As a result, they found it difficult to accept that death was the end of everything. They went to great lengths, as evidenced by their pyramids, to preserve life after death.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Reincarnation.gif" image_alt="Reincarnation" image_title="Reincarnation" %}

The stars and planets were religiously significant because they were thought to 'rule' the land when they were ascendant (the seven-day week). Aside from that, astronomy was largely limited to forecasting the Nile. 

#### [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia){:target="_blank"}

Mesopotamia, on the other hand, shared many similarities with China. They were both dependent on two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates in Egypt and the Huang He and the Yangtze in China.

The land was barely habitable, and living here required advanced technical skills such as hydraulics, irrigation systems, canals, dams, and so on. The forces of disruption were identified as powerful gods in this case. They were terrified of divine wrath that would destroy everything. 

There was no distinction between "rational science" and magic among the ancient Mesopotamians. Doctors prescribed magical formulas to be recited as well as medicinal treatments when a patient became ill.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Ummânū.jpg" image_alt="Ummânū" image_title="Ummânū" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Borsippa.jpg" image_alt="Borsippa" image_title="Borsippa" %}

The Diagnostic Handbook, written by the [ummânū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu){:target="_blank"}, or chief scholar, [Esagil-kin-apli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esagil-kin-apli){:target="_blank"} of [Borsippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsippa){:target="_blank"} during the reign of Babylonian king [Adad-apla-iddina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adad-apla-iddina){:target="_blank"} (1069–1046 BC), is the most extensive Babylonian medical text. In East Semitic cultures, the main medical authority was an [āšipu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%A1ipu){:target="_blank"}, a type of exorcist healer. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Asipu.jpg" image_alt="Ašipu" image_title="Ašipu" %}

The ancient Mesopotamians were well-versed in the chemical properties of clay, sand, stone, and other natural materials, which they put to practical use in the production of pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime plaster, and waterproofing.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Haruspex.jpg" image_alt="Haruspex" image_title="Haruspex" %}

Animal physiology was extensively studied for divination purposes; the anatomy of the liver, which was regarded as an important organ in [haruspicy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex){:target="_blank"}, was studied in particular depth. The behaviour of animals was also studied for divinatory purposes. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Divination.gif" image_alt="Divination" image_title="Divination" %}

Mathematics and astronomy thrived here. The system of degrees, minutes and seconds was developed here as a system of weights and coinage. They thought that heavenly phenomena were natural disasters and to record these, came a highly descriptive form of astronomy, which the Greeks later took and perfected.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Perfection.gif" image_alt="Perfection" image_title="Perfection" %}

Not much is known about how early Babylonian mathematics grew to such an extent. There are texts from 1700 BCE that show that the Babylonians not only knew the Pythagorean relation well but also used it extensively. They could solve quadratic equations, compound interest, and even exponents.

Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians appear to have been far more interested in studying the way the gods had ordered the universe than in gathering information about the natural world for the sake of gathering information. 

#### [Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula){:target="_blank"}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Qur'an.jpg" image_alt="Qur'an" image_title="Qur'an" %}

Ancient science was regarded as a valuable asset by the Arabs. The sacred book of Islam, the [Qur'ān](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran){:target="_blank"}, praised medicine in particular as a divinely inspired art form. Astronomy and astrology were thought to be one way of seeing what God intended for humanity. Contact with Hindu mathematics and the requirements of astronomy stimulated the study of numbers and geometry. As a result, the writings of the [Hellenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks){:target="_blank"} were eagerly sought and translated, and much of antiquity's science made its way into Islamic culture. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Plato.jpg" image_alt="Plato" image_title="Plato" %}

Greek medicine, astronomy and astrology, and mathematics, as well as [Plato's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato){:target="_blank"} and, especially, [Aristotle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle){:target="_blank"} great philosophical works, had all been assimilated into Islam by the end of the fourth century. By the end of the ninth century, Greek medicine, astronomy and astrology, and mathematics, as well as Plato's and, especially, Aristotle's great philosophical works, had been assimilated into Islam. The Arabs did not stop with assimilation. They both criticised and innovated. 

The construction of great astronomical observatories that provided accurate observations against which the Ptolemaic predictions could be checked aided Islamic astronomy and astrology. Numbers fascinated Islamic thinkers, and this fascination inspired the development of algebra (from the Arabic al-jabr) and the study of algebraic functions. 

## [Greek Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_classical_antiquity){:target="_blank"}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Ancient Greece.jpg" image_alt="Ancient Greece" image_title="Ancient Greece" %}

The Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians' contributions to astronomy, mathematics, and medicine had entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy.

The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the [pre-Socratics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy){:target="_blank"}, offered competing answers to the question posed in their contemporaries' myths: *"How did the ordered cosmos in which we live come to be?"*

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Thales of Miletus.jpg" image_alt="Thales of Miletus" image_title="Thales of Miletus" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Ionian philosophers.png" image_alt="Ionian philosophers" image_title="Ionian philosophers" %}

[Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus){:target="_blank"} (640–546 BCE), identified by later authors such as Aristotle as the first of the [Ionian philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_School_(philosophy)){:target="_blank"}, proposed non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Leucippus.jpg" image_alt="Leucippus" image_title="Leucippus" %}

[Atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism){:target="_blank"}, the theory that all matter is made of indivisible, imperishable units called atoms, was introduced by [Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucippus){:target="_blank"} (5th century BCE).

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Aristarchus.jpg" image_alt="Aristarchus of Samos" image_title="Aristarchus of Samos" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Eratosthenes.jpg" image_alt="Eratosthenes" image_title="Eratosthenes" %}

The first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system was the astronomer [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos){:target="_blank"}, while the geographer [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes){:target="_blank"} accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Hippocrates.jpg" image_alt="Hippocrates" image_title="Hippocrates" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Hippocratic Oath.jpg" image_alt="Hippocratic Oath" image_title="Hippocratic Oath" %}

[Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates){:target="_blank"} (c. 460 BC – c. 370 BCE) and his followers were the first in medicine to describe many diseases and medical conditions, as well as develop the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath){:target="_blank"} for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Euclid.jpg" image_alt="Euclid" image_title="Euclid" %}

The mathematician [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid){:target="_blank"} established the foundations of mathematical rigour in Hellenistic Egypt. [Theophrastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus){:target="_blank"} wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first taxonomy and investigating mineral properties such as hardness. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Theophrastus.jpg" image_alt="Theophrastus" image_title="Theophrastus" %}

Later, at the height of the Roman Empire, the early Christians approached worldly wisdom with ambivalence: on the one hand, the rhetoric and arguments of ancient philosophy were traps and delusions that could mislead the simple and unwary; on the other hand, the sophisticated and educated of the empire could not be converted unless the Christian message was presented. 

The early Christians were caught up in metaphysical debates, some of which involved physics before they realised it. In purely physical terms, what was the nature of Jesus, for example?
How was it possible for anyone to have two distinct essential natures, as claimed for Jesus? Such inquiries revealed how crucial knowledge of Greek thinkers' arguments on the nature of substance could be to those attempting to establish a new theology. 

## [Medieval European Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_science_in_the_Middle_Ages){:target="_blank"}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Medieval Europe.jpg" image_alt="Medieval Europe" image_title="Medieval Europe" %}

Medieval Christendom primarily confronted Islam through military crusades, in Spain and the Holy Land, and through theology. This conflict resulted in the restoration of ancient knowledge to the West.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Crusade.gif" image_alt="Crusade" image_title="Crusade" %}

The medieval world was portrayed as a time of darkness, superstition, and hostility to science and learning by thinkers of the 18th century Enlightenment. It was, on the contrary, a time of great technological vitality. The advances made may appear trivial today, but that is because they were so fundamental. 

An equal amount of effort was expended in gaining a scientific understanding of nature, but it is critical to understand how medieval thinkers put this knowledge to use. As evidenced by the technological fertility, medieval Europeans had no deep prejudices against utilitarian knowledge. However, the areas in which scientific knowledge could be usefully expressed were limited. Instead, science was viewed primarily as a means of comprehending God's creation and, by extension, the Godhead itself. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Aquinas.jpg" image_alt="Aquinas" image_title="Aquinas" %}

In the Middle Ages, there was no conscious conflict between science and religion. God, according to [Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas){:target="_blank"}, was the author of both the book of Scripture and the book of nature. The reason, the faculty in which humankind was created in the image of God, was the guide to nature.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/God.gif" image_alt="God" image_title="God" %}

The brilliance of medieval science was its seamless integration of science, philosophy, and theology into a magnificent and understandable whole. 

## Rise of Modern Science

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/New World.jpg" image_alt="New World" image_title="New World" %}

The discovery of the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World){:target="_blank"} at the end of the 15th century dealt the first serious blow to ancient authorities' traditional acceptance.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Ptolemy.png" image_alt="Ptolemy" image_title="Ptolemy" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/St Augustine.jpg" image_alt="St. Augustine" image_title="St. Augustine" %}

[Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy){:target="_blank"}, the great astronomer and geographer, insisted that only Europe, Africa, and Asia could exist, and Christian scholars from [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo){:target="_blank"} on had accepted it, because otherwise, men would have to walk upside down at the antipodes. However, Ptolemy, St. Augustine, and a slew of other authorities were incorrect.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Wrong.gif" image_alt="Wrong" image_title="Wrong" %}

The dramatic expansion of the known world also fueled the study of mathematics, as wealth and fame awaited those who could turn navigation into a true and trustworthy science. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Hermes.jpg" image_alt="Hermes" image_title="Hermes" %}

[Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus){:target="_blank"} was said to be a contemporary of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses){:target="_blank"}, and the Hermetic writings contained an alternative story of creation that emphasised humans far more than the traditional account. God had created humanity entirely in his image: a creator, not merely a rational animal. By creating, humans could imitate God. To do so, they needed to learn nature's secrets, which they could only learn by torturing nature with fire, distillation, and other alchemical manipulations. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Moses.gif" image_alt="Moses" image_title="Moses" %}

Success would be rewarded with eternal life and youth, as well as freedom from want and disease. It was a heady vision, and it gave rise to the idea that humankind could bend nature to its will through science and technology. This is the modern view of science, and it should be noted that it is unique to Western civilization. 

## [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution){:target="_blank"}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Scientific revolution.jpg" image_alt="Scientific revolution" image_title="Scientific revolution" %}

After all of this, one of the most important periods in science history was about to begin, with a man named [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus){:target="_blank"}, who dared to place the Sun, rather than the Earth, at the centre of the Solar System.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Dare.gif" image_alt="How dare you" image_title="How dare you" %}

Copernicus reduced a complexity bordering on chaos to elegant simplicity in a single stroke. This system had a simplicity, coherence, and aesthetic charm that drew those who believed God was the supreme artist to it. His was not a rigorous argument, but aesthetic considerations in science history should not be overlooked.

More than physics and astronomy were at stake because one of the Copernican system's implications threatened the very foundations of modern society. Two distinct scientific movements emerged in the century and a half following Copernicus. The first was critical, while the second was inventive and synthetic. They collaborated to discredit the old cosmos and, eventually, to replace it with a new one.

Following Copernicus, many other scientists such as [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe){:target="_blank"}, [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler){:target="_blank"}, and [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei){:target="_blank"} would emerge to challenge the Church's earlier Aristotelianism.

[Aristotelianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism){:target="_blank"} was rapidly dying by the end of the first quarter of the 17th century, but there was no satisfactory system to take its place. As a result, there was a sense of scepticism and unease, because, as one observer put it, *"the new philosophy calls all into doubt."*

This void was largely responsible for the success of [René Descartes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes){:target="_blank"} rather crude system. Descartes used matter and motion to attack the fundamental Copernican problems.

Later, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton){:target="_blank"} would arrive with his genius. Newton's three laws of motion and his principle of universal gravitation were sufficient to govern the new cosmos, but only with God's assistance, according to Newton. Gravity, he implied several times, was a direct divine action, as were all forces of order and vitality. For Newton, absolute space was necessary because space was the "sensorium of God," and the divine abode had to be the ultimate coordinate system. Finally, Newton's analysis of the mutual perturbations of the planets caused by their gravitational fields predicted the solar system's natural collapse unless God intervened to restore order.

The publication of Newton's [Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica){:target="_blank"} marks the culmination of the Copernican movement and, as such, has always served as a symbol of the scientific revolution. This paved the way for the Classical Age of Science, which we are all familiar with. 

# Conclusion

> "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind" -Albert Einstein

Although many civilisations were ahead of their time in terms of science, they all lacked an explanation.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Wuxing.png" image_alt="Wuxing" image_title="Wuxing" %}

The Chinese believed in a cosmic order that appeared to be founded arbitrarily on the balance of opposing forces ([yin-yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang){:target="_blank"}) and the harmony of five elements ([Wuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy)){:target="_blank"}) (water, wood, metal, fire and earth). It was not stated how or why this harmony was achieved.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Why.gif" image_alt="Why" image_title="Why" %}

Similarly, the Egyptians perceived the world to be harmonious because the capricious gods so desired. The same was true for Mesopotamian cultures.

There were many differences between ancient Greece and other civilizations, but religion was perhaps the most significant. The puerility of Greek religion, in contrast to Mesopotamian and Egyptian religions, is striking. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Mycenaean.png" image_alt="Mycenaean" image_title="Mycenaean" %}

Both great river civilizations, China and Egypt developed complex theologies that served to answer most, if not all, of humanity's big questions about its place and destiny. The Greek religion, however, did not. It was, in fact, nothing more than a collection of folk tales, more suited to a campfire than a temple. Perhaps this was the result of the collapse of an earlier Greek civilization, the [Mycenaean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece){:target="_blank"}, at the end of the second millennium BCE, when the Dark Age descended on Greece and lasted three centuries.

All that remained were poets' stories of gods and men, which only dimly reflected Mycenaean values and events. Such were [Homer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer){:target="_blank"} great poems, the [Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad){:target="_blank"} and the [Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey){:target="_blank"}, in which heroes and gods interacted freely. Indeed, they mingled too freely, because the gods appear in these stories as little more than immortal adolescents, whose tricks and feats are childish when compared to the concerns of a [Marduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk){:target="_blank"} or [Jehovah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah){:target="_blank"}.

In the sense that theology provides a coherent and profound explanation of the workings of both the cosmos and the human heart, there was no Greek theology. As a result, there were no simple answers for inquiring Greek minds. Consequently, there was plenty of room for a more in-depth and ultimately more satisfying mode of inquiry. Philosophy and its oldest offspring, science, were thus born. 

{% include lazyload.html image_src="/assets/Driving Forces behind Scientific Advancement I - Religion/Abrahamic religions.jpg" image_alt="Abrahamic religions" image_title="Abrahamic religions" %}

Overall, surveys show that people who believe in [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions){:target="_blank"} are more conflicted with science than those who believe in Buddhism, Hinduism, and so on. As all religions have the same goal, to serve as a path to God, it is logical to say that the conflict that people feel is only on the surface. It appears unlikely, if not absurd, that some religions would be at odds with science while others would not.

As a result, while we often consider science and religion to be opposed, the truth is that they have been inextricably linked throughout history. Where religion fell short of satisfying human curiosity, science stepped in, and vice versa. Both, however, necessitate an open mind. It could be argued that they form the 2 sides of the same coin.

According to [Stephen Jay Gould's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould){:target="_blank"} ["non-overlapping magisteria" (NOMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria){:target="_blank"}, science and religion deal with fundamentally separate aspects of human experience and thus coexist peacefully when each stays within its domain. 

For those of you who, like me, prefer not to be bothered by such matters, let us follow Sheldon Cooper's lead and join Mathology. As of now, it appears to be the simplest thing around.

So what do you think? Think religion and science conflict and contradict each other? Do you feel that only one can exist within one's mind, or do you perhaps feel that one cannot exist without the other? Do you think God exists? What do you think  his nature could be? Tell me what's on your mind.
